00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.330
Leander: Okay, it's recording it says

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.410
To the clothes.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:15.389
Xing Chen: Okay. Thanks, Linda. So the background, sorry, is that when I was doing my PhD. I'll do you think a lot of different tests. And every time I

4
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:36.420
Xing Chen: Wanted to use a new test for example of trying to do a test are and then Nova. I had to look up the MATLAB function of the health function and learn how to use that test. And so basically what kind of input arguments to to give the function and how to structure the data.

5
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.410
Aline Mak: In

6
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.640
Xing Chen: The particular way.

7
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:53.550
Xing Chen: That the function would be able to parse it and actually carry out the analysis. And the thing is that this differs for every single function. So each function has a particular

8
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:06.450
Xing Chen: Way in which it wants you to structure your data. And all of this is quite arbitrary and I realized that this is something that I would have to look up every single time.

9
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:24.090
Xing Chen: So I compiled the most commonly used functions and I made a little scripts, where I basically listed each of these functions. And then I took some notes and to remind myself of how to use this so that I wouldn't have to

10
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.860
Xing Chen: Look up the map help function again in the future.

11
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:51.570
Xing Chen: And so I use this script. It's called steps demo as a kind of reference manual for myself where everything is in one place and I have example. So it's really easy for me personally to just look up what I need to find. So let's just go through a few examples. SO FAR T test.

12
00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:11.670
Xing Chen: When you want to test for example, if the meanest distribution of a distribution is different from a particular value or to test whether to distribution have significantly different means. Then you've got different types of tests. Teach us so you have, for example,

13
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.340
Xing Chen: Some function called T tests we have something called T test two

14
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:41.790
Xing Chen: And you can use them in many different ways. So for example, if you just want to compare whether the mean of the distribution is different from a particular value such as zero, then you just give this function t test one input argument, which is your distribution.

15
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:50.160
Xing Chen: If you want to test if it's significantly different from a particular value than you give that as a second input argument.

16
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.220
Xing Chen: If you want to test whether the means of two distributions are different from each other. Then you input the to distribution.

17
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:17.190
Xing Chen: And so on and so forth. So, um, this is I just like having the scripts, because then I can remember when I need to use t test and how to use it with the input arguments or when I need to use t test to

18
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:41.790
Xing Chen: Okay. And the second thing is that when I run a T test I get my results. So I have my each. So that could be one or zero, depending on whether hypothesis. The null hypothesis is rejected on that my p value my confidence interval and various statistics.

19
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:52.050
Xing Chen: And so let's say I just run one of these. And so I do find my distribution and

20
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.510
Xing Chen: I highlight my code and I pressed F9 to run the code and now I am going to

21
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.460
Xing Chen: My teachers.

22
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:16.530
Xing Chen: And here, as you can see basically when I run the T test, it returns all of these outputs which is HP confidence interval and steps.

23
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:31.260
Xing Chen: And the thing is that every time I run a test. I, I get this information friends about if I do not suppressive a colon here. Um, but it's not in the right format for

24
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:48.420
Xing Chen: Writing it in a thesis or in an article and that's very annoying. So I always need to have my code which actually parses the results in a way that I can copy and paste into my manuscript, for example.

25
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.640
Xing Chen: Also, I have this standard line of code that I always use where I just automatically

26
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.690
Xing Chen: translate the results. I get from the output of the T test into something that I can literally just copy and paste into my document.

27
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:24.030
Xing Chen: So this makes life a lot easier because then I'm not. I'm copying and pasting from here, the P value and then going into steps and copying and pasting degrees of freedom and my t statistic and so on.

28
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.990
Xing Chen: And so these are the main reasons why I have this kind of static code.

29
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:42.540
Xing Chen: And I'm not going to go through everything in detail, but I'll share. I'll be sharing this code along with the presentations and and lectures online.

30
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:57.720
Xing Chen: So you can always use this for your own reference or if you want to, you know, very quickly be able to report your statistics and degrees of freedom and so on. It can use these as example. So I'm channel. I'll people

31
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:10.800
Xing Chen: Should probably understand what exactly it's doing before, just kind of copying and using it, but I have a lot of different statistics in here. So you have free to use this as a reference document.

32
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.580
Xing Chen: So the same for non parametric test. For example, signed to rank test.

33
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.530
Xing Chen: Or rank some tests I have

34
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.520
Xing Chen: Correlations and partial correlations

35
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.830
Xing Chen: And I also have a for each of these tests I have these example I create example data.

36
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:46.140
Xing Chen: And then I for example, here I have example Dina I create a little plot. And then I have

37
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.290
Xing Chen: The lines of code that show me how to perform the statistical analysis.

38
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.010
Xing Chen: You can have. Yeah. Want to have to tell test and and so on can get quite detail.

39
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.540
Xing Chen: I also have test for a nova and this is really useful finds because

40
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:15.180
Xing Chen: You need to know how to format your, your data. So for example, if you have a data set. You have to know

41
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.110
Xing Chen: How to orient your matrix. So, um,

42
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:33.510
Xing Chen: Yeah, I think I probably shouldn't going to allow detail now, but it just reminds me of how to format to do that properly so that the anoma function can actually read it.

43
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.320
Xing Chen: So bossa nova test.

44
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.840
Xing Chen: Also Crisco Wallace test.

45
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:59.730
Xing Chen: Test, test for normality test for Skegness our potatoes business which is a measure of how keep the distribution is as far as good as the city.

46
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.890
Xing Chen: That's what equal variances.

47
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:19.890
Xing Chen: Guys were good. Goodness of Fit stuff. And again, one of the reasons why I have these kinds of letters, this chi square is a technique that can be used for a lot of different situations. So there's

48
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:37.410
Xing Chen: Quite a few different statistical analyses that all use high square and it can get a little confusing, it's priceless as a Varian, I swear to goodness of fit. For example, and these are all things that, um, yeah, I just wanted to document and having one thing

49
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.230
Xing Chen: I'm Pearson's chi square test of independence.

50
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:54.210
Xing Chen: And and some other, more complex tests for things like circular statistics and so on. Yeah. So this was really just to

51
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.910
Xing Chen: Show you what the script was about and give you the option of using it in case it's useful in the future.

52
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.130
Xing Chen: Okay, so are there any questions.

53
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.590
Inge van Ooijen: No, it's pretty nice.

54
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.250
Xing Chen: Yeah.

55
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.660
Erika Juarez: Very useful.

56
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.450
Xing Chen: Oh, was that

57
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.000
Erika Juarez: This is going to be very useful. Thank you.

58
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.900
Xing Chen: If that semester. Oh no. Erica.

59
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.870
Erika Juarez: Yeah. Now you said those was going to be very useful.

60
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.740
Thanks. Well,

61
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.570
Xing Chen: Yeah, that's I'm hoping one day.

62
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.340
And I made this for myself.

63
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:53.370
Xing Chen: Okay, great. So if you have any questions later, feel free to email me and Leander is your tutor for this afternoon.

64
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.010
Xing Chen: hang around for a little bit, just

65
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:02.790
Xing Chen: To just to help me under if necessary, and then I'll see you again at the end of the day.

66
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.580
Livia dominicus: Don't forget to stop the recording.

67
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.230
Leander: Okay.

68
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.880
Xing Chen: Yeah, and so on.
