# Matlab minilectures #

Series of minilectures created for the ONWAR Matlab course 
organized by Xing Chen and Alexander Heimel.

These folders contain the matlab-scripts used, movies with the
presentations and extra material.

MLX files are a new Matlab livescript format. The files can
be read by Matlab versions before 2016b, but will only show
the Matlab code, not the accompanying text.

For corrections and suggestions, please email Alexander Heimel 
or Xing Chen.
